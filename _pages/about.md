I am a Research Assistant at HKUST(GZ). My research interests focus on the theory and applications of large language models (LLMs) and AI4Science. My interests lie in enhancing the capabilities of AI through efficient model design. I am particularly passionate about integrating mathematical theories with machine learning to push the boundaries of what AI systems can achieve.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying active by playing badminton, soccer, and basketball. I also love photography and cooking.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
